Very often people work with data are provided with a large collection of data and tasked with finding something intresting and useful from the data which can help them find insights in to whatever they are doing. 

This is exactly what we do in Explorartory Data Analysis (EDA). It's about how do one go about exploring the data with the aim of analyzing them. 


The data itself will have some interesting patterns. It may or may not be useful to the user. So what process or procedures are involved in it.

- [Data Sourcing](./data-sourcing-and-cleaning/#data-sourcing) 

    The process of finding the data and loading in to the system

- [Data Cleaning](./data-sourcing-and-cleaning/#data-cleaning)

    The procured data will not always be perfect. It may contain issues like encoding etc. The data has to be purged of the issues and inconsitencies. 

- [Univariate Analysis](./univariate-analysis/)

    You take only one variable in the data and analyze it.

- [Bivariate Analysis](./bivariate-analysis/)

    Univariate Analysis extends to Bivariate Analysis. You start analyzing if one variable influences the other variable some how. 

- [Derived Metrics](./derived-metrics/)

    Derived Metrics are metrics which is derived from other metrics. An example would be to derive the `age` from `DOB` or other similar metric.
