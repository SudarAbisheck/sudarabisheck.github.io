Many a time, you may require a very large amount of data for your analysis which may need too much time and resources to acquire. In such situations, you are forced to work with a smaller sample of the data, instead of having the entire data to work with.

Consider the example of **Exit Polls**. It is impossible to collect from all the population in a country. Data will be collected from a randomly chosen relatively small group of people and the results will be extrapolated to the entire population. 

How to do can you be confident that the results obtained from a small dataset are valid for a larger group of people? Using Inferential Statistics, we **estimate** the population data from the small dataset, but not find the exact values. This is because when you don't have the exact data, you can only make reasonable estimates about it with a limited level of certainty. Therefore, when certainty is limited, we talk in terms of probability.

This process of **“inferring”** insights from sample data is called **“Inferential Statistics”**.
