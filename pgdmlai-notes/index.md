I am part of the third cohort (June 2018) of students who took the Post Graduate Diplomo in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence ([PGDMLAI](https://upgrad.com/machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence/)) course conducted by International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIITB) and [UpGrad](http://www.upgrad.com).

These are my personal notes taken during the course.
